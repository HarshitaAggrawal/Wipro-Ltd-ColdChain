## 1. Deployment Guide

This document explains about how to deploy Cold Chain solution using ARM template. You can deploy the ARM template in the following two ways:
- **Using Azure portal** 
- **Using Azure CLI**

This document explains about input parameters, output parameters and points to be noted while deploying ARM template.

## 2. Prerequisites for Deploying ARM Template

### 2.1. Integrating Applications with Azure Active Directory
    
Any application that wants to use the capabilities of Azure AD must first be registered in an Azure AD tenant. This registration process involves giving Azure AD details about your application, such as the URL where it’s located, the URL to send replies after a user is authenticated, the URI that identifies the app, and so on. 
    
#### 2.1.1. To Register a new Application using the Azure Portal 

1.	Sign in to the **Azure portal.**
2.	In the left-hand navigation pane, click the **Azure Active Directory(symbol)** service, click **App registrations,** and click **+ New application registration.**

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d1.png)

3. When the **Create** page appears, enter your application's registration information:
  - **Name**: Enter the application name
  - **Application type:**
      * Select "Web app / API" for client applications and resource/API applications that are installed on a secure server. This setting is used for OAuth confidential web clients and public user-agent-based clients. The same application can also expose both a client and resource/API.
  - **Sign-On URL:** For "Web app / API" applications, provide the base URL of your app. For example, **https://localhost** might be the URL for a web app running on your local machine. Users would use this URL to sign in to a web client application.
  
4.When finished, click **Create.**

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d2.png)

## 4. ARM Template Deployment 

Azure Resource Manager allows you to provision your applications using a declarative template. In a single template, you can deploy multiple services along with their dependencies. The template consists of JSON and expressions that you can use to construct values for your deployment. You use the same template to repeatedly deploy your application during every stage of the application lifecycle.
Resource Manager provides a consistent management layer to perform tasks through Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure portal, REST API, and client SDKs.
Resource manager provides the following features:
-	Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.
-	Repeatedly deploy your solution through the development lifecycle and your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
-	Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.
-	Define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.
-	Apply access control to all services in your resource group because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.
-	Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.

## 6. Device Configuration

### 6.1. Build and Deploy Snap to Gateway

Below listed are the steps to be followed to build and deploy snap to Rigado Cascade-500 IoT Gateway.

**a. Development Host** - This computer or virtual machine should have Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and will be used to edit source files, test scripts, and interact with the snapcraft CLI. It may have any architecture (amd64, x86, etc). This device must have an HCI0 interface with BLE enabled.

**b. Build Host** - NodeJS snaps are not cross-compilable, so this build computer must have an armhf processor architecture and have enough resources to build the snap. The Raspberry Pi 3 is recommended because it has the armhf architecture, and can run the Ubuntu Core OS (which simplifies the build process). 

**I. Setting up the Development Host**

1.	Install Node.js (>=6.11.4).

2.	Install required libraries with the following command:

    **$ sudo apt update**

    **$ sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev g++ python2.7 git build-essential curl libssl-dev npm**

3.	Download the project (codebase of Gateway) to your development host and navigate to the project and enter the following command:

    **$ npm install**

4.	This will install all the dependencies which are required for the project mentioned in package.json file.

#### 6.1.1. Snap Building:

1.	For now, the Node.js plugin for snapcraft doesn’t support a cross-platform build. Raspberry Pi is required for building the snap. For installation of Raspberry Pi follow the steps mentioned in the link <https://docs.rigado.com/en/latest/creating-apps/prereqs.html#developer-prereqs-rpi.>

2. Once Raspberry Pi is set up, login by using the following command:

$ ssh abc@175.21.10.9 [IP address of the RaspberryPi]

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d97.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d98.png)

3. Copy the project folder from your local to Raspberry Pi

   **$ scp -r user@175.21.10.4:/home/user/Project-Titan/.**

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d99.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d100.png)

4. Install Classic

   **$ sudo snap install --beta --devmode classic**
   
5.	Once Classic is installed, switch to classic mode by entering the following command:

   **$ cd Gateway Source Code**
   
   **$ sudo classic**

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d101.png)

6. In Classic mode, install snapcraft:

      **$ sudo apt update**
      
      **$ sudo apt install snapcraft build-essential git**
      
7.	Once snapcraft is installed [in classic mode] navigate to the project folder, where the snapcraft.yaml file is present, change the version number to the higher number than the one present in the file.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d102.png)

**NOTE:** if you’re building the snap multiple times make sure that the version should be updated to the next number in **snapcraft.yaml** file. Ex: If version is 1.9.10 make it as 1.9.11 for the next build.

8. You should change the **function App Url(API_endpoint)** and **IoT Hub connection string(IoT Hub name) url** in **Config.json** file for before building the snap.

**Note**: You can take the URL from the output section of ARM template.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d129.PNG)

**Note**: If the Deployment type is Standard or Premium, you have to provide Traffic Manager URL

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d96.png)

**Note**: If you want to re-build the snap you need to delete the following folders

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d96-1.png)

To build the snap, enter the following command

**$ sudo snapcraft**

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/d104.png)

9. Once the snap is built, it will create an abc_test_1.0.1_**armhf.snap** file. Copy this snap from the build host [i.e Raspberry Pi] to development host [i.e. Ubuntu 16.04 machine] using the following command:

**$ scp abc_test_1.0.1_armhf.snap** <user@175.21.10.4:/home/user/>

This will copy the snap to Local at the path mentioned.
